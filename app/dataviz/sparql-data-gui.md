European Union Sparql Data Provider   
Ontodia needs to have an access to data,  
therefore you have to provide a SPARQL  
endpoint URL in environment property.   

We've set European Union Data Provider   
to use for demonstration purposes. 

## Ontodia

Ontodia is a JavaScript library that allows to visualize, navigate and explore data in the form of an interactive graph based on underlying data sources.

## What is Ontodia for?

Ontodia allows you to create and persist diagrams made from existing data - relational, object, semantic.

It was designed to visualize RDF data sets in particular, but could be tailored to almost any data source by implementing a data provider interface.  

## Core features

- Visual navigation and diagramming over large graph data sets
- Rich graph visualization and context-aware navigation features 
- Ability to store and retrieve diagrams
- User friendly - no graph query language or prior knowledge of the schema required
- Customizable user interface (by modifying templates for nodes and links) and data storage back-end

## How to try it?

- Click `gui app build data diagram` to open the GUI in your browser.   
- Drag and drop to build diagrams
- Search relational data

## About SPARQL

To access the data of data.europa.eu, a machine-readable SPARQL endpoint allows querying the RDF descriptions of datasets.  

SPARQL is an RDF query language, i.e. a semantic query language for databases.  

The SPARQL search of the portal offers a graphical user interface to enter your SPARQL queries.  

For programmatic use, a machine-readable endpoint is available at the following URL: https://data.europa.eu/data/sparql?locale=fr   

The following section provides a short introduction to the SPARQL language and some examples that are specific to the context of data.europa.eu.   

For a complete documentation of the language, the specifications of SPARQL can be found on the W3C web site.
