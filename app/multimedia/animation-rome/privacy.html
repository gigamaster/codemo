		<h3>www.ro.me<br />Privacy Policy</h3>
		<p>
			@radical.media LLC provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive from users of our Website located at www.ro.me. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Website. Your use of the Website following any such notice will signify and constitute your assent to and acceptance of such revised Privacy Policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, capitalized terms used below have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service available at http://www.ro.me.
		</p>
		<p>
			As used in this Privacy Policy, the terms "using" and "processing" information include using cookies on a computer, subjecting the information to statistical or other analysis and using or handling information in any way, including, but not limited to collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, combining, disclosing and transferring information within the United States or internationally.

				<p>
					<strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services and to enable Website users to enjoy and easily navigate the Website.
				</p>
				<p>
					Except to the extent you voluntarily include any information about yourself that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Information") in Content (e.g., original artwork) you submit to us via the Website, and except for any e-mail address you choose to submit to us via the Website, we do not collect and maintain any Personal Information about you.  We may collect other information that you provide or give us access to or otherwise post on the Website or submit to us ("Non-Identifying Information").  Information we collect or you submit is used mainly to provide the Services, send you information about the status of Content you submit to us (e.g., whether we have accepted or rejected it for inclusion in certain aspects of the Services), and to administer your inquiries.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Log Data</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					When you visit the Website, our servers automatically record information that your browser or device sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Website, pages of our Website that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Website, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Website and for the Website's technical administration, to increase our Website's functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor it to our users’ needs. We may aggregate, analyze and evaluate Log Data for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Cookies</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Like many websites, we use "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. We may use cookies to enable certain features of the Website, to better understand how you interact with the Website and to monitor aggregate usage by Website users and web traffic routing on the Website. Third party advertisers on the Website, if any, may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Website or all functionality of the Services.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Phishing</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Identity theft and the practice known as "phishing" are of great concern to Radical. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your social security number, or national identification numbers in an unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission's website at <a href = "http://www.ftc.gov">http://www.ftc.gov></a>.

					<strong>Information Sharing and Disclosure</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Please do not submit any information to us via the Services that you intend to keep strictly private.  If you choose to include Personal Information about yourself in Content that you create and submit via the Website, such as in original artwork or objects created by you using the tools available on the Services, you recognize and agree that such Content may be publicly available on the Website and that we may sell or share such Content to third parties including, without limitation, to third parties in connection with the commercial exploitation or promotion of the music, videos or artists featured on the Website and related activities (“Music Partners”).  Except as set forth below, we will not share any e-mail address you submit to us via the Website with any person who is not a Music Partner.  Non-Identifying Information may be disclosed for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					We may share aggregated information that does not include Personal Information and we may otherwise disclose Non-Identifying Information (including Log Data) with service providers or our customers for analysis, demographic profiling and other purposes. Any information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Third Party Service Providers</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services, to provide the Services on our behalf, to perform Website-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Website's features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are used. These third parties may have access to your Personal Information.  If they do, this access is only so that they may perform these tasks on our behalf and they will be obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Radical cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Radical or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Data Transfer</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Your information may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.  If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Radical transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there.  Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Business Transfers</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Radical may sell, transfer or otherwise disclose some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.

					<strong>Security</strong>

					We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via conspicuous posting on our Website in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

					<strong>Links to Other Sites</strong>
				</p>

				Our Website contains links to other websites. The fact that we link to a website or display an ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with any of those third parties, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.

			<p>
				We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at 435 Hudson Street, 6<sup>th</sup> Floor, New York, NY 10014. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Information, we will delete such information from our files.

				<strong>California Privacy Rights</strong>
