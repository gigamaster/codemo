        <h1>Blockly Threex&nbsp;<small>Graphic Language for three.js</small></h1>
        <p class="lead">Sometime it is easier to learn something with 
          graphical representation than with textual one.
          I experimented on this using 
          <a href='https://code.google.com/p/blockly/'>Blockly</a>
          and
          <a href='http://threejs.org/'>three.js</a>.
          You controls a robot in webgl and modify its behavior as you wish.
          Definitly very fun way to learn programmation thru game development.

          <h2>All Graphical</h2>
          <p>The language you use to code is <a href='https://code.google.com/p/blockly/'>Blockly</a>,
            a web-based, graphical programming editor.

          <h2>WebGL thru three.js</h2>
          <p>
            Always trying to make three.js easier for beginners. Now you can use it without even knowing javascript.
            Maybe without even knowing how to code itself.

          <h2>Easier to Learn</h2>
          <p>
            Thanks to <em>Blockly</em>, you can't do any syntax error.
            Thanks to <em>three.js</em> you got fancy display where you can have fun customizing your very
            own character.
