# vengi voxel editor

This is an emscripten compilation of the [vengi voxel editor](https://github.com/vengi-voxel/vengi)

This is a collection of voxel tools. It includes a voxel editor with animation support  
and loading/saving into a lot of voxel volume formats. There are other tools like e.g. a thumbnailer for 
your filemanager and a command line tool to convert or modify between several voxel formats.
