### Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN) 

is an editor for graphically expressing a Case,  
as well as an interchange format for exchanging   
Case models among different tools.

In this context: "A Case is a proceeding that  
involves actions taken regarding a subject in  
a particular situation to achieve a desired  
outcome" and it is derived from the concept  
of Case management used e.g. in the legal and   
medical worlds.

While BPMN deals with predictable processes,  
CMMN is more oriented to focus on supporting  
processes that are unpredictable, not repeatable,   
weakly-structured, and knowledge-intensive.

CMMN can often require ad-hoc actions.

A consortium of 11 companies contributed to the  
development of CMMN, which is now being maintained   
by the Object Management Group.    
v1.0 of CMMN released in May 2014   
amended by v1.1 in December 2016
